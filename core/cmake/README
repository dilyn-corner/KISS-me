cmake
________________________________________________________________________________

CMake is cross-platform free and open-source software for build automation,
testing, packaging and installation of software by using a compiler-independent
method. CMake is not a build system but rather it generates another system's
build files. It supports directory hierarchies and applications that depend on
multiple libraries. It is used in conjunction with native build environments
such as Make, Qt Creator, Ninja, Android Studio, Apple's Xcode, and Microsoft
Visual Studio. [0]

[001] Special Considerations
________________________________________________________________________________

Cmake has been modified to include support for (system) zstd, as zstd provides
almost all compression and decompression methods on this system. Additionally, a
sed is included to resolve issues with netbsd-curses & ccmake, the curses Cmake
interface.


[002] Setup
________________________________________________________________________________

Cmake supports to output methods on Linux; 'GNU Makefiles' and 'Ninja' with the
former being the default value. These values are set via the CMAKE_GENERATOR
environment variable.

Every package which utilizes Cmake in its build system will force the usage of
Ninja. This is primarily for performance improvements.  One could accomplish a
similar feat by merely setting the following environment variable in your
.profile or shell runtime file.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                              |
|  $ export CMAKE_GENERATOR=Ninja                                              |
|                                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The current method was chosen simply because I was too irritated by always
forgetting that I never have Samurai installed, and my builds were constantly
being interrupted :)
