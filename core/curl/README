[001] Special Considerations
________________________________________________________________________________

Curl is built statically to avoid catastrophic failures from appearing in very
core features of the system. Specifically, I don't tend to keep build sources
around for any longer than I have to. I'd quite like to be able to download my
sources to fix my builds if I were to, say, nuke my box.


[002] Setup
________________________________________________________________________________

The package manager supports many download tools and will also use curl if it is
available. To explicitly tell the package manager to use it, set the KISS_GET
environment variable to 'curl'.


[003] Usage
________________________________________________________________________________

Refer to the manual pages and command help output.
