KISS-me - A KISS repository for forks, projects, and fun
________________________________________________________________________________

2) NonGNU experimentation

Other branches are for:
1) Strangeness
2) Fun


The structure of this branch
________________________________________________________________________________

This branch is intended to be a daily driver on the bleeding edge. Ouch.

It isn't meant to be useable by everyone and it certainly isn't *for* anyone.
However, it is the version I use.

The intention is minimalism; a system that does the bare minimum to keep itself
running and gets out of your way. It's a power user's system.


PRs welcome, issues appreciated.
